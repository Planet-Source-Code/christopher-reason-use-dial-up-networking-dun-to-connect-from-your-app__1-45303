### Description

Make a connection to the internet using Dial Up Networking (DUN) from your application. This is so easy! Please see the comments in the Standard Module for more explanation.

PLEASE VOTE IF YOU LIKE IT!

Thanks,

### More Info
 
You may want to include the name of a specific dialup connection if there are more than one. I have not tested this aspect yet, but I believe the code will open the default DUN only with out the added name.(see module for details)

Assumes that the user of this code will have DUN installed on the target machine.

Internet connection made simple.
